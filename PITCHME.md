# Styled components

Short description

---

### Problem with current paradigm

- Today: Weâ€™re living in the component age. Lego block style code is what we try to achive.
- Problem: CSS is still a document style addition excluding the component structure.
BEM etc tries to solve that issue but does not really do that.
- Solution: Enter Styled-components.
