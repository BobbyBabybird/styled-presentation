# Styled components

Short description

---

### Problem with current paradigm

- We strive to build lego style components.
- Problem: CSS is still a document style addition excluding the component structure.
BEM etc tries to solve that issue but does not really do that.
- Solution: Enter Styled-components or other CSS-in-JS solutions.

### Why Styled Components

- Network effect.
- Was happy with CSS Modules. This takes it a step further.
- Doesn't limit css developers.
- Works well with React.
- Generating HTML and CSS. Not recreating the wheel.
